# quarantine-fonts

Miscellaneous font projects in different states of progress.

During the Coronavirus pandemic quarantine in 2020, I kept wondering what may
become of all the work hidden away in type designers’ drawers when worst comes
to worst.

I have been starting out in type design in 2007. Since then, a lot of stuff
accumulated in my font folders. To start designing a typeface is easy.
Finishing it is the hard part. The state of these font projects differs
wildly. Some can’t even be used to write a complete test word, as you can see
below. Nevertheless I decided to release this collection of unfinished fonts as
open source in the hope that it may be useful to somebody. I’m thinking mainly
type designers, as this really is raw material that needs to be refined and
developed before it can be useful for type users. Source files in
[Glyphs](https://glyphsapp.com) format are included.

If you are looking for the more advanced typefaces among this bunch, check
these out:

* Conta: Another coding font. Monospaced and proportional variants, italics.
* Grotesk 812: A condensed grotesque typeface.
* Malerblock: A signpainter’s typeface. Activate stylistic sets for measurements
  on the letters.
* Mergenthaler Antiqua: A digitization of a forgotten typeface by Hermann Zapf.
* Pathos: A monumental sans-serif with classical proportions. I designed it for
  our wedding rings and invitations.
* Selectric Century: A digitization of the Century typeface from IBM’s
  Selectric Composer.
* Soccer Sans: A constructivist sans with extra low legibility. Ideal for
  soccer kits.
* Stecker: A typeface made of round elements.
* Topography: A version of the classic German cartography typeface.

Some other fonts that I designed are not part of this collection:
[Sudo](https://www.kutilek.de/sudo-font/),
[FF Hertz](https://www.kutilek.de/ff-hertz/),
[FF Uberhand](https://www.kutilek.de/ff-uberhand/).
